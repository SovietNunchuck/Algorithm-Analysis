Step-by-Step Bubble Sorting Process

First Pass
1. (2, 7, 23, 6, 30, 15, 30, 22) 7 is swapped with 2 because it is greater.
2. (2, 7, 23, 6, 30, 15, 30, 22) No swap occurs because 7 is not greater than 23.
3. (2, 7, 6, 23, 30, 15, 30, 22) 23 is swapped with 6.
4. (2, 7, 6, 23, 30, 15, 30, 22) No swap occurs because 23 is not greater than 30.
5. (2, 7, 6, 23, 15, 30, 30, 22) 30 is swapped with 15.
6. (2, 7, 6, 23, 15, 30, 30, 22) No swap occurs because 30 is not greater than 30.
7. (2, 7, 6, 23, 15, 30, 22, 30) 30 is swapped with 22.

Second Pass
1. (2, 7, 6, 23, 15, 30, 22, 30) No swap occurs because 2 is not greater than 7.
2. (2, 6, 7, 23, 15, 30, 22, 30) 7 is swapped with 6.
3. (2, 6, 7, 23, 15, 30, 22, 30) No swap occurs because 7 is not greater than 23.
4. (2, 6, 7, 15, 23, 30, 22, 30) 23 is swapped with 15.
5. (2, 6, 7, 15, 23, 30, 22, 30) No swap occurs because 23 is not greater than 30.
6. (2, 6, 7, 15, 23, 22, 30, 30) 30 is swapped with 22.
7. (2, 6, 7, 15, 23, 22, 30, 30) No swap occurs because 30 is not greater than 30.

Third Pass
1. (2, 6, 7, 15, 23, 22, 30, 30) No swap occurs because 2 is not greater than 6.
2. (2, 6, 7, 15, 23, 22, 30, 30) No swap occurs because 6 is not greater than 7.
3. (2, 6, 7, 15, 23, 22, 30, 30) No swap occurs because 7 is not greater than 15.
4. (2, 6, 7, 15, 23, 22, 30, 30) No swap occurs because 15 is not greater than 23.
5. (2, 6, 7, 15, 22, 23, 30, 30) 23 is swapped with 22.
6. (2, 6, 7, 15, 22, 23, 30, 30) No swap occurs because 23 is not greater than 30.
7. (2, 6, 7, 15, 22, 23, 30, 30) No swap occurs because 30 is not greater than 30.

Fourth Pass
No swaps occur. The list is sorted.

Step-by-Step Merge Sorting Process

1. Divide the list into two smaller lists. Repeat until lists only contain one item.
	(7, 2, 23, 6, 30, 15, 30, 22)
	   /			\
    (7, 2, 23, 6)	(30, 15, 30, 22)
      /       \            /         \
  (7, 2)     (23, 6)   (30, 15)    (30, 22)
  /    \     /     \    /     \     /     \
(7)    (2) (23)   (6) (30)   (15) (30)    (22)

2. Merge and sort by combining pairs of lists. Repeat until only one list remains.
(7)    (2) (23)   (6) (30)   (15) (30)    (22)
  \    /     \    /     \     /      \     /
  (2, 7)    (6, 23)     (15, 30)     (22, 30)
       \     /                \       /
    (2, 6, 7, 23)          (15, 22, 30, 30)
            \                  /
       (2, 6, 7, 15, 22, 23, 30, 30)
